Features:

      * a buffer to remove text that is followed by backsapces,
      * replacement of non-grahic characters,
      * line split includeing backtracking and hyphen insertion,
      * left, centre or right aligned or justified text,
      * expansion of tabs to spaces.

Each of  these is implemented separately,  taking a function  like 'getchar'
and returning a new function that is  also like 'getchar'.  This enables the
features to be composed in any order (though not necessarily with meaningful
results), or used separately.  In any case the final function can be used in
the same way  as getchar.  I haven't  posted most of the code  because it is
quite long.  But I have intentionally made this paragraph quite long because
it was  originally a  single line -  but here is  formatted using  the code.

<c>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "bsbuff.h"
#include "nongraphic.h"
#include "linesplit.h"
#include "align.h"
#include "detab.h"

int tabsize = 6;
int linelen = 70;
int maxrollover = 7;

int main(void)
{
      int c, (*getch)(void);

      configure_tabs(tabsize);

      getch = backspace_buffer(&getchar);
      getch = replace_nongraphic(getch);
      getch = split_lines(getch, linelen, maxrollover);
      getch = align(getch, linelen, maxrollover, ALIGN_JUSTIFIED);
      getch = detab(getch, linelen);

      while ((c = (*getch)()) != EOF)
            putchar(c);

      return 0;
}
</c>
